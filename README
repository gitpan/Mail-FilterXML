SYNOPSIS
      use Mail::FilterXML;
      my $filter = new MailFilter(rules => "/home/matt/mail_rules.xml");
      $filter->process();

DESCRIPTION
    This module builds upon Mail::Audit by Simon Cozens. Mail::Audit
    is a module for constructing filters, Mail::FilterXML is a
    filter of sorts. FilterXML is just made up of some logic for
    processing an email message, and is controlled by the contents
    of a rules file, so if I wanted to block a particular sender, I
    could just add an element to my rules file, like:

    <Rule type="from" content="microsoft.com" folder="Trash" />

    The content attribute can contain perl regexps, such as
    *\.microsoft\.*$, etceteras.

FUTURE
    I will be adding new "types" of rules, and the ability to reject
    or altogether ignore messages, as possible in Mail::Audit. Any
    feedback or patches are welcome.
